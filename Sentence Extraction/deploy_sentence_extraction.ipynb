      "Summary\n",
      "\n",
      "The climate is changing. Historical climatic design data is becoming less representative of the future climate. Many future climate\n",
      "risks may be significantly under-estimated. Engineers cannot assume that the future will be like the past. Historical climate trends\n",
      "cannot be simply projected into the future for engineering planning, design, operations and maintenance of infrastructure.\n",
      "\n",
      "The best available scientific evidence indicates that the global climate is changing at an unprecedented rate and that emissions\n",
      "of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (GHGs) from human activities are contributors to this change. Recently recorded\n",
      "climate change is associated with more extreme weather events, and the frequency of these events is expected to increase over\n",
      "time.  These events will intensify the damage and failure of infrastructure.  Any mitigation of human-induced climate change is\n",
      "predicted to have multiple benefits, such as:\n",

      "1. Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "1.1 Background\n",
      "\n",
      "The primary duty of engineers is to hold paramount the safety, health and welfare of the public, the protection of the environment,\n",
      "and promote health and safety within the workplace.\n",
      "\n",
      "The current state of scientific knowledge concludes that the climate is changing, and will continue to change, at a rate that is\n",
      "likely accelerated by anthropogenic releases of greenhouse gases. Furthermore, evidence suggests that climate change has led\n",
      "to changes in climate extremes such as heat waves, record high temperatures and, in many regions, heavy precipitation in the\n",
      "past half century (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2014). The IPCC, in its report Managing the Risks of Extreme\n",
      "Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (2012) notes that climate extremes, or even a series of non-\n",
      "extreme events, combined with social vulnerabilities and their exposure to risks can produce climate-related disasters [1].\n",
      "\n",
      "Changing climate conditions, particularly weather patterns that deviate from historical climate ranges, may adversely affect the\n",
      "integrity of the design, operation, and management of engineered systems. In some cases, changing climate conditions can pose\n",
      "unaccounted for risks. It is the engineer’s duty to take all reasonable measures to ensure that those systems appropriately\n",
      "anticipate the impact of changing climate conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The engineer’s job is to assess and minimize such risks within the scope of their work, which includes being a trusted advisor to\n",
      "the client while balancing client needs and the project budget. This understanding imposes a responsibility of due diligence on\n",
      "the engineering profession to address the issue of climate change within engineering works. This plays out in two ways. First,\n",
      "engineers, and those who retain them for design of public facilities and infrastructure, will have to accommodate climate change\n",
      "into their work to assure public health and safety. Second, given the level of awareness of this issue and high visibility of impacts\n",
      "arising from more intense and severe weather events, engineers that do not exercise due diligence regarding changing climate\n",
      "may ultimately be held personally or jointly liable for failures or damages arising from climate impacts on engineered systems.\n",
      "Scientific literature indicates significant departures from historical climate averages occurring globally and engineering designs\n",
      "must account for an expanded range of climate in their operating environments\n",
      "\n",
      "Engineers have an important role to play in mitigating the rate and magnitude of climate change to the extent that is possible\n",
      "through reduction GHGs. In Canada, the federal and provincial regulatory environments mandate measures to decrease, monitor\n",
      "and report GHG emissions and reductions, in addition to the development of carbon pricing and market mechanisms. Engineers\n",
      "are central to the development and implementation of strategies and technologies that will lower carbon emissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Engineers have a wide diversity of occupations and responsibilities. Many are involved in different types of economic and product\n",
      "development in a cost effective, socially and environmentally responsible manner. Engineers develop new projects and public\n",
      "infrastructure and keep existing facilities operating effectively and efficiently. They explore resources and design economic and\n",
      "sustainable methods of developing these resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "Engineers work as employees, employers, procurement and selection officers, researchers, academics, consultants, and in\n",
      "regulatory and managerial roles. They frequently work in environments where they must collaborate with other specialists as part\n",
      "of multi-disciplinary teams. An individual may or may not have control of, or be solely responsible for, a project. To the greatest\n",
      "extent possible, engineers should understand and manage the public health and safety aspects of the project.\n",
      "\n",
      "Engineers are expected to exercise professional judgment and due diligence in the execution of their work. That expectation\n",
      "includes practising in accordance with the regulators’ code of ethics for the jurisdiction in which they are licensed, complying with\n",
      "provincial and federal laws, restricting practice to areas of personal expertise, and practicing in accordance with established\n",
      "standards.\n",
      "\n",
      "Engineers may or may not be directly managed by other engineers. Regardless, engineers will expect to be supported in making\n",
      "decisions that appropriately accommodate changing climate conditions even if data pertaining to these changes is sparse.\n",
      "Management and other team members also have a societal responsibility for the design, construction, operation and managing of\n",
      "safe engineered systems that may be impacted by changing climate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Legislation and regulation in the field of climate change adaptation and mitigation is evolving rapidly.  Concurrent with such\n",
      "regulation, engineers need guidance on how to address climate change in their professional work. This guideline is intended to\n",
      "fill this gap.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.2 Limitations\n",
      "\n",
      "While engineers have a duty to inform their clients or employers regarding matters related to climate change adaptation,\n",
      "mitigation and resiliency that may impact the professional activities for which they are responsible, they are generally not in a\n",
      "position of authority to ensure that the appropriate action is taken.\n",
      "\n",
      "Engineers are not expected to assume responsibility for considering the implications of climate change adaptation in engineered\n",
      "systems or mitigation efforts beyond the scope of their authority. The engineer is not responsible for implementing solutions that\n",
      "address climate change adaptation if it is not within the engineer’s scope of authority. The scope of authority is provided by the\n",
      "client or the employer.\n",
      "\n",
      "4\n",
      "\n",
      "\f",
      "While the engineer presents the alternatives and rationale for implementing solutions that address climate change adaptation or\n",
      "mitigation, the decision on the form of such solutions remains with the client or employer. Nevertheless, in keeping with\n",
      "professional obligations an engineer can and should appropriately communicate the risks associated with ignoring\n",
      "recommendations related to climate change adaptation or mitigation to their employer or client. Such communications should be\n",
      "clearly documented in the appropriate files.\n",
      "\n",
      "If warranted, due to the long-term implications to public safety and/or the environment caused by the engineer’s\n",
      "recommendations being ignored, the engineer may have to communicate the concerns more broadly if all other means, including\n",
      "internal communication with the client or employer, are exhausted.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.3 Scope\n",
      "\n",
      "This National Guideline is strictly advisory in nature and intended to assist engineers to balance competing interests as an\n",
      "essential element of practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "This document, through amplification and commentary of each principle, summarizes how an engineer should strive to adjust\n",
      "their practice to anticipate the effects of a changing climate on engineered systems and ensure resilience.\n",
      "\n",
      "International scientific knowledge on climate change has also advanced to the point where anthropogenic GHG emissions are\n",
      "known to accelerate climate variability, thereby necessitating climate mitigation efforts. Energy efficiency measures, adoption of\n",
      "renewable energy, and innovative low carbon technology are three principles that can specifically address climate change\n",
      "mitigation.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.4 Purpose\n",
      "\n",
      "The purpose of the National Guideline is intended to inform, guide, and encourage engineers, Certificate of Authorization/Permit\n",
      "to Practice holders and consulting engineering firms to proactively manage the impacts of a changing climate on engineered\n",
      "systems. The document also provides a basis for understanding and accepting definitions for key terms and concepts applied in\n",
      "assessing climate-induced risks. It suggests adopting energy efficiency measures, renewable energy options, and innovative low\n",
      "carbon technologies and other strategies to reduce GHG emission and support efforts to reduce the rate of change and variability\n",
      "of our future climate.\n",
      "\n",
      "This guideline offers a considered interpretation of the responsibilities of engineers to adapt to a changing climate and mitigate\n",
      "the change. The application of the principles described in this guideline will always be a matter of professional judgment.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.5 Definitions\n",
      "\n",
      "This guideline uses terms that may not be used in an engineer’s day-to-day practice. These are defined in Appendix A. As this\n",
      "document evolves, new definitions will be added as necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "5\n",
      "\n",
      "\f",
      "2. Climate change and engineers\n",
      "\n",
      "Engineers are bound by their code of ethics [3] to:\n",
      "\n",
      "Hold paramount the safety, health and welfare of the public and the protection of the environment and promote health and safety\n",
      "within the workplace\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, engineers are bound to:\n",
      "\n",
      "Be aware of and ensure that clients and employers are made aware of societal and environmental consequences of actions or\n",
      "projects and endeavor to interpret engineering issues to the public in an objective and truthful manner\n",
      "\n",
      "These expectations provide engineers with a duty of care and a foundation for addressing or discharging their professional\n",
      "responsibilities. That is, engineers must be mindful of the public health and safety aspects of their professional activities and are\n",
      "also bound to disclose issues that could compromise the integrity of their professional work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Climate change imposes a new and evolving pressure on the practice of engineering. How does this play out in real professional\n",
      "practice?\n",
      "\n",
      "Professionals can only be accountable for establishing that their work addresses concerns that could reasonably be identified\n",
      "given the state of knowledge at the time they executed the work. But what does reasonable mean in this context? In engineering\n",
      "practice, reasonable is defined by the standard of practice. In this context, the expectation is that engineers should behave in a\n",
      "way that draws on the composite of the entire professional community’s opinion of how a typical member should behave in the\n",
      "same circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is notable that this guideline does not require that the professional be an expert. Rather, it is based on how a typical engineer,\n",
      "with a normal level of professional experience and training, would discharge their responsibilities. However, this does not absolve\n",
      "the engineers from keeping themselves abreast of the climate science as it relates to their professional practice. In fact, it is\n",
      "incumbent on engineers to learn about future climate projections, adaptation and mitigation tools and resources relevant to their\n",
      "work to be able to:\n",
      "\n",
      "»\n",
      "\n",
      "hold paramount public health and safety;\n",
      "\n",
      "»\n",
      "\n",
      "protect the environment; and,\n",
      "\n",
      "»\n",
      "\n",
      "offer services in consideration of the changing climate to their clients where appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "This learning can be through a combination of attending continuing professional development events, conferences, courses,\n",
      "workshops, seminars, webinars, technical talks and self-study. In engineering practice, when the engineer identifies areas of\n",
      "practice that are outside of the scope of their training and expertise, they are required to seek input and advice from other\n",
      "qualified professionals who do have that expertise.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to recognize that engineers have a higher standard of practice than a layperson. They have more years of training\n",
      "and experience with engineering matters and are uniquely qualified to identify and respond to issues that may compromise the\n",
      "public health and safety implications of their work. In this way, the engineer will normally be held to a standard of practice that\n",
      "exceeds that of a layperson but is somewhat less than that of an expert. This is not always clearly defined and is a source of\n",
      "constant review by engineering regulators and the legal profession. As the body of knowledge increases, new understandings\n",
      "developed by experts become generally adopted within normal engineering practice. As a result, the measure of a reasonable\n",
      "standard of practice will continue to evolve over time. This is the fundamental reason why codes and standards undergo constant\n",
      "review and revision.\n",
      "\n",
      "The word reasonable is used throughout this document. This language is used in the context of the above commentary. The\n",
      "guideline offers a series of principles for a engineer to incorporate into their practice to reflect an understanding that the climate is\n",
      "changing and that historical weather and climate information traditionally used by the professional may require adjustment. Such\n",
      "adjustments would account for the changing climate, based on scientifically defensible methods and projections that are\n",
      "documented as part of the engineering process. This guideline outlines principles for demonstrating due diligence by adjusting\n",
      "normal engineering practice to reasonably address climate risks given the current level of understanding of the issue.\n",

      "3. National guideline principles\n",
      "\n",
      "The principles that comprise the National Guideline are divided into three categories. Within each category there are several\n",
      "principles that engineers should apply within their professional practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "The eleven principles constitute the professional practice required to initiate climate change adaptation actions that will improve\n",
      "resiliency and reduce the rate and magnitude of change. Each principle is described in the following format:\n",

      "\n",
      "All engineers are responsible and need to be engaged\n",
      "\n",
      "Engineers should integrate an understanding of the impacts of climate change, weather, and resiliency into the normal day-to-\n",
      "day design, operation, maintenance, planning and procurement activities for which they are professionally responsible. These\n",
      "activities constitute the scope of engineering work.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.1.1 Amplification\n",
      "\n",
      "Engineers participate in many facets of the Canadian economy. Instituting meaningful change into professional practice requires\n",
      "recognition of this reality. Simply changing professional expectations in one element of the design, supply, construction, or\n",
      "operation chain will be difficult and ineffective. Ultimately, professionals can only institute adaptation measures when there is a\n",
      "broader acceptance that these actions are required.\n",
      "\n",
      "Improving the resiliency of engineered systems such as civil infrastructure to the impacts of extreme weather and changing\n",
      "climate serves as the basis for broader acceptance of adaptation measures. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on\n",
      "Climate Change (2014), resilience is:\n",
      "\n",
      "“the capacity of social, economic, and environmental systems to cope with a hazardous event or trend or disturbance,\n",
      "responding or reorganizing in ways that maintain their essential function, identity, and structure, while also maintaining\n",
      "the capacity for adaptation, learning, and transformation”.\n",

    "The K-nearest neighbors (KNN) is a lazy, supervised machine learning algorithm. In order to classify new data points, the KNN algorithm calculates the distance of a data point to other training data points where the distance can be of any type (Euclidean, Manhattan, Hamming, etc). Next, the $k$ nearest data points are found where $k$ is integer-valued. Then, the initial selected data point is classified to a label according to what the majority of the $k$ nearest data points belong in. The advantage of KNN lies in its ease of implementation. Despite the fact that there may be more fitting methods, the KNN algorithm is proven to overall provide relatively accurate results in spite of its simplicity."
